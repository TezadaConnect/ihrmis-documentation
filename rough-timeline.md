# ESTIMATED TIMELINE RANGE
This rough estimation of time range is based in development perspective only.

### TIMELINE DESIGN TEMPLATES 2-3
- Designing plates can range 1-2 days
- Complex design plates will range 2-3 days 

### ESTIMATED TIMELINE DESIGN FOR BACKEND RANGE 1
- Back-end api endpoint range 1 day

### CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COMPLEX 
- Connectivity for reading will be half a day 
- Connectivity for Form submittion will range 1-2 days
- Complex and large form will range 1-5 days depending to revisions between backend - frontend for compatibility

### TIMELINE FOR ONE PROGRAMMER 
Usually in agile methodology, sprints should be 3 months long with a team of 3
- Sprint one will end in another 2 months
- Sprint two will end about 2 months
- Sprint three 2 months
- Sprint four 3 months
